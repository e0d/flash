Some rough and ready Clojure code for producing YAML versions of the Fred Jehle Conjugated Spanish Verb Database.

https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs

The code will evolve to become a language learning aid for me.

The desire to have a YAML representation of the verb database is to facilitate ease of editing, correction and contibution.
